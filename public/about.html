<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samuel Del Bosque and I am from South Texas.
  I was born and raised in a border city called Laredo, Texas
  where 97% of the population was hispanic.
</p>

<p>I am an engineering student in Duke University 
who is learning more about web development. I am 
excited to learn more and perhaps create some really cool projects.
</p>

<p>I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering, but am
  hoping to supplement my academic learning with practical skills
  that could be useful to me down the line.
