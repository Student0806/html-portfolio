<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>Forest Gump is a cinematic Masterpeice that
   has a great story, great characters,
   great storytelling, an amazing soundtrack,
   and wholesome life lessons that anyone
   can apply to their own lives. 
</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie's story is among the best ever
   created. It has very compelling characters
   that take the audience into the humanity of 
   an incarcerated individual. It is probably
   the best prison break movie of all time.
</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Happynes</h3>
<p>This movie is very simple yet powerful
   in the way that it communicates simple
   principles of love and devotion to one's family.
   In many respects it is both hearbreaking and completely
   uplifting.
